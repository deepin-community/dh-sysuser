dh-sysuser (1.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix description of sysuser-helper package: s/it's/its. (Closes: #844342)
    + Thanks: Toby Speight <T.M.Speight.90@cantab.net>
  * Remove system user without home directory at package uninstall. If
    there is no home directory, it seems safe to assume that no files
    belong to that user, and removing that user will not cause harm.
  * Create system users with /usr/sbin/nologin as shell.
  * Do not impose dependency on bin:adduser. It is unneeded, since
    bin:sysuser-helper uses useradd(8), which is provided by bin:passwd,
    with is of required priority.
  * Document in manpage, that sysuser-helper delegates its job to useradd(8)
    (Closes: #848240)
  * Remove useless account locking in prerm.
  * Ensure that content of /etc/skel is not copied into home directory.
  * Update Vcs-* and Homepage fields in debian/control.
  * Update standards version to 4.1.3 (no changes needed)
  * Bump compat version to 11 (no changes needed)
  * Document and implement login, that system user is removed
    when it has either empty home directory or none at all (Closes: #848239)

dh-sysuser (1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rethink what this package actually does. Instead of removing user, it
    is just locked. It drastically simplify maintainer script code and
    avoids tricky situation with `deluser --remove-home'.
    (Closes: #840469)
    + Thanks: Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>
  * New binary package: sysuser-helper. This way maintainer script
    contains as little logic, as possible.
  * New option: home without arguments. It creates home directory
    for system user somewhere under /var/lib.

dh-sysuser (0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove empty 'debian/docs' file
  * Fix typo in 'debian/copyright'
  * Add dependency on perl, which is required for

  * Delete user with --force flag, allowing removing users,
    which have running processed.
